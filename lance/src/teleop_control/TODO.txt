1. export control params to launch system
2. improve assisted mining (upgrade to use belt position feedback):
    a. determine # motor rotations <--> hopper full
    b. improve f(track speed, trencher depth, trencher speed) -> belt duty cycle
    c. position-based belt duty cycle
    d. hopper full notification based on belt position
3. use # belt rotations for assisted offload
3. separate robot control public interface from internal state interface (wrapper + impl)
