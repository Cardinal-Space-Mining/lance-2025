## Branches
Different branches contain different deployments, as indicated by branch name. PLEASE DO NOT MERGE DEPLOYMENT-SPECIFIC BRANCHES INTO EACH OTHER! They are separated to simplify the workspace complexity for each deployment (as well as reduce clone/pull overhead), so doing this would defeat the purpose.

- `base`: Base branch
- `robot`: Code deployed on the robot
- `remote`: Code deployed to an external processor running tag detection
